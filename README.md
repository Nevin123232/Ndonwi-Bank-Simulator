This is a banking simulator where a user can create a banking profile. When their profile is created the user can create banking accounts (savings, checking, and retirement accounts). When the user has concluded their session, their information is encrypted and stored in a text file for future use (if the user wishes to do more in the future). 

The user starts by either:
a) Creating an account 
b) re-initializing their previous bank profile data

After this process takes place the user can create, delete, transfer money, and conduct other tasks with bank accounts in addition to editing their bank profile data.

In order to simulate data being stored into the cloud (as many other banking applications do), data will be encrypted and stored into a text file so that the user can re-log into their account in the future. Data is saved and reloaded. 

In order to ensure account security, the user's username, password, and other profile information is required to modify bank profile properties, in addition to that the user's bank profile history and bank account history is recorded in order to see any irregularities with their data so that action can be taken. 

Music is also played throughout program execution. 

All properties belong to their respective owners. No copywright intended. 


The .java files are required to run the program [within the banking package]
- start.java: responsible for running the main project, contains all user interaction functions, uses other functions to outout information to the user.
- Account.java: contains the template for the account class. This is responsible for bank account functions like deposits, withdrawals, and transfers.
- Profile.java: contains the template for the profile class, this is where the user will create their profile. Profile functions and properties take place/ are stored here.
- Filing.java: information is filed using the functions in this class.
- sound.java: this is where sound is played in the program. Themes and sound effects are played at this stage of the program.
- there are other sound files where music and themes are played in the program.


The profiles with numbers are example accounts:
